# **General Practices**
- Use of Camel casing for variable names.
- The variable names must clearly outline what is stored.
- Use of Pascal casing for class and function names.
- {{Header | safe}} must be added to the the top of each html page for the navigation menu.
- {{Footer | safe}} must be added to the bottom of each html page for the footer.

- `~/templates/example.html` for all html templates that are loaded with Flask.
- `~/static/styles/example.css` for css files to be served.
- `~/static/scripts/example.js` for javascript files to be served.
